            The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup,
            is an international association football competition contested 
            by the senior men’s national teams of the members of 
            the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), 
            the sport’s global governing body. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The championship has been awarded every
            four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930,
            except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The current champion is Germany,
            which won its fourth title at the 2014 tournament in Brazil.
